# How to ask the director a question

The director's standing instruction: *ask me explicit questions rather than pondering my meaning;
speak in direct terms about the game impact, not the technical detail; and if the question is
about a visual element, show me clearly labelled images as I read it.* Every agent follows this.

## When to ask

Ask the moment the next step depends on a judgement that is the director's: anything the player
sees, decides, feels or pays for; anything that spends money; anything that changes a decision
already in `DECISIONS.md`; any look. Do not ask about things the pack already answers, and do not
ask the director to choose between technical implementations that produce the same game.

Never park a question inside a progress report. Never guess at a visual. Never delay a merge
because a question was not asked.

## The format

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool when it is available; otherwise write the same structure in the
message. At most four questions per message. Each question:

1. **One decision.** Not "thoughts on the battle UI?" but "Should the enemy's weapons be visible
   before the fight starts?"
2. **Game impact first, in plain words.** What the player will experience under each option. No
   file names, no class names, no numbers unless the number is the thing being chosen.
3. **Recommended option first, marked (Recommended),** with one line on why.
4. **Every option has its cost or trade-off in one line.**
5. **Visual questions carry labelled images in the same message.** Label options A/B/C in the
   image itself (large text, top-left), show them at the size the game will show them, side by side,
   and include a 2× crop if detail matters. Anything that moves gets a 3-second clip, not a contact
   sheet.
6. **Say what happens if there is no answer** ("the branch waits" or "I proceed with A and it is
   reversible").

## Example (good)

> **Should a surgeon's failed roll be able to kill the patient?**
> - **Yes, rarely (Recommended).** Surgery becomes a real decision; deaths on the table become
>   stories. Cost: some players will feel robbed; the odds must be shown before they choose.
> - No, only maim. Safer, but the choice to operate loses weight.
> - No answer: I build "yes, rarely" behind a data flag; flipping it is a one-line change.

## Example (bad)

> I've been thinking about the injury system and there are a few ways we could go. One approach
> would be to model surgery as a skill check with a failure table that includes death, which has
> implications for `Injury.gd` and the save schema…

## After the answer

Write the answer into `docs/DECISIONS.md` in the same PR that acts on it, with the date and the
question id. If the director's answer conflicts with the pack, say so in one paragraph, propose
the better option, then do what the director decides.
